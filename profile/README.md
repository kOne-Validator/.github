Step 1: Update your system
Before installing Docker, it's essential to ensure that your system’s packages are up to date. Run the following commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
Step 2: Install Docker
Install the required packages:

sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
Add Docker’s GPG key:

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
Add Docker’s repository to APT sources:

echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
Update your package index and install Docker:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
Verify Docker is installed correctly:

sudo systemctl status docker
Step 3: Install Docker Compose
Download Docker Compose:

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Apply executable permissions:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Verify Docker Compose installation:

docker-compose --version
Gaia Node Installation
Once Docker and Docker Compose are installed, follow these steps to install Gaia Node.

Step 1: Clone the Gaia Node Repository
You need to clone the Gaia Node GitHub repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/gaia-network/gaia-node.git
cd gaia-node
Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
Inside the Gaia Node directory, you'll find a .env.example file. Copy this file and rename it to .env:

cp .env.example .env
Open the .env file and configure the variables based on your setup. Key variables you might need to modify include:

GAIA_NODE_NAME: Set a unique name for your node.
GAIA_NETWORK: Define the network type (e.g., mainnet, testnet).
Step 3: Start the Gaia Node
After configuring the environment, use Docker Compose to build and run your Gaia Node:

docker-compose up -d
This command starts the Gaia Node in detached mode. To view logs and ensure that the node is running correctly, use:

docker-compose logs -f
You can stop the node at any time by running:

docker-compose down
Gaia Node Uninstallation
If you need to remove the Gaia Node from your system, follow these steps:

Step 1: Stop the Gaia Node
Ensure the node is stopped before proceeding with the uninstallation. Run the following command to stop the containers:

docker-compose down
Step 2: Remove Docker Containers and Images
You’ll need to remove all containers and images associated with the Gaia Node. First, list all Docker containers:

docker ps -a
Identify the containers associated with the Gaia Node, then remove them:

docker rm <container_id>
You can also stop and remove all containers at once with:

docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
To remove Docker images:

docker rmi <image_id>
Alternatively, to remove all Docker images:

docker rmi $(docker images -q)
Step 3: Remove Gaia Node Files
If you cloned the Gaia Node repository to your local machine, you can delete the directory to remove all files related to the Gaia Node:

rm -rf gaia-node
Step 4: Uninstall Docker and Docker Compose (Optional)
If you no longer need Docker and Docker Compose on your system, you can remove them as follows:

To remove Docker:

sudo apt remove docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
To remove Docker Compose:

sudo rm /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Verification of Gaia Node Status
After starting or stopping your Gaia Node, you can verify its status using Docker commands. To check if the node is running:

docker-compose ps
You can also check logs for any issues or errors:

docker-compose logs -f
Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
Docker Daemon Not Running: If you encounter an error related to the Docker daemon, ensure Docker is running:

sudo systemctl start docker
Environment Variable Misconfigurations: Double-check your .env file for any misconfigured variables. Missing or incorrect values can cause the node to fail.

Network Issues: Ensure you have a stable internet connection, as the node requires network access to sync with the Gaia blockchain.
